# Armadillo Pirate

**Armadillo Pirate** is a page that provides you with a random animal and a random profession for you to draw. Just press the button and you would be presented with a random animal and a random profession, followed by two links for further details on the two and some random wikipedia pictures of the animal in question.

It is also and example of poor aesthetics, bad manners and awfull class and variable naming.
There are also a couple of scripts that I used to ~~scrap~~ **gather** the data.

The animals are from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_by_common_name
The professions are from: http://arcana.wikidot.com/list-of-all-occupations
